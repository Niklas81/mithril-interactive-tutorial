<h3>Namespacing</h3>
<code>todo = {}</code>
<p>We start by creating a container object that will hold our self contained component. Namespacing the component this way helps to prevent other components' properties colliding with ours.</p>
<h3>The View</h3>
<p>Now let's create a template to be drawn to the screen. There's no functionality and we provide a sample
task just to visualize our goal.</p>

<div class="dothis">
  Play with the view code in the editor. Although you can add styles, they will ultimately be applied in-line
  which forces you to use <code>!important</code> declarations in your stylesheets. It's best to apply CSS from
  an external file.
