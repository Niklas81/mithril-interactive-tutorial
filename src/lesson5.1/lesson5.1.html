<h3>Namespacing</h3>
<code>todo = {}</code>
<p>We start by creating an object that will hold our self contained
component. Namespacing the component this way helps to prevent
other components' properties colliding with ours.</p>
<h3>The View</h3>
<a class="docs-icon"
   href="http://mithril.js.org/getting-started.html#view"
   target="_blank">
</a>
<p>Now let's create a template to be drawn to the screen.
We won't add any functionality yet, but we provide a sample
task to visualize our goal.</p>

<div class="dothis">
  Play with the view code in the editor. Although you can add styles
  as we did with fontFamily, they will ultimately be applied in-line
  which forces you to use <code>!important</code> declarations
  in your stylesheets. It's best to apply CSS from an external file.
