<p>
  Our Todo List App begins life with no tasks. Input will come from the user through the View and 
  we'll store new tasks in a Model. 
</p>

<div class="dothis">
  src/lesson5.1/Todo5.1.coffee
</div>

<p>The Model defines two classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Todo -- individual tasks with a desctiption and a "done" indicator</li>
<li>TodoList -- array of Todos for display in the View</li>
</ul>

<p>In our Model, the Todo class will store a string (description) of one task. Beyond storing data,
the Model is also responsible for managing our app state. In our case, we need
the Model to keep track of the "done" state of each Todo. We use an input checkbox to visually
reflect that state.</p>
