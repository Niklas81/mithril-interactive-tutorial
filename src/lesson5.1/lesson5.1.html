<p>
  Our Todo List app begins life with no tasks. Input will come from the user through the View and 
  we'll store new tasks in a Model. 
  <a class="docs-icon"
   href="http://mithril.js.org/getting-started.html#model"
   target="_blank">
</a>
</p>

<div class="dothis">
  src/lesson5.1/Todo5.1.coffee
</div>

<p>The Model defines two classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>todo.Todo -- individual tasks with a desctiption and a "done" switch</li>
<li>todo.TodoList -- an array of Todos for display in the View</li>
</ul>

<p>In our Model, the Todo class will store a description (string) of one task.</p>

<p>Beyond storing data, the Model is also responsible for managing app state.
In our case, we need the Model to keep track of the "done" state of each Todo.
When the user checks a task, "done" is set to true.</p>
<code>done("true")</code>
<p>A boulean switch like done/notdone is a perfect case for using an m.prop getter/setter.
We use an input checkbox to visually reflect that state.</p>

<p>
  The TodoList is where we will store Todo instance objects added when the user
  adds a new todo.
