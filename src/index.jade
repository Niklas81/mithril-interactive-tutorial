    title MIT - Mithril Interactive Tutorial

  body
    | Welcome to Mithril

    // We can mount our app on document.body or any descendent element.
    // This tutorial is mounted on the body, so the text "Welcome to Mithril"
    // (and these comments) will be replaced with the tutorial app.
    // On a slow connection you might briefly see the welcome message.
    // In practice we would leave the body empty.

    // bundle.js incudes Mithril. It must load before m.mount() can be called.
    // Under the Elements tab of DevTools you won't see a script tag for
    // bundle.js, it has also been replaced by the tutorial app.
    // Lucky for us, it was loaded earlier.

    // You might see an error in the console like this:

    // Please ensure the DOM element exists before rendering a template into it.
    
    // To ensure that that the DOM element exists,
    // load your main script at the end of the body like this:

    script(src='bundle.js')
