<p>If the view could only hold static data, there would be no need
to learn Mithril. We can funnel data into the view from several
sources. As we shall see, the view can print the data or alter it
to enhance its presentation.</p>

<h3>Data from the contoller</h3>
<div class="dothis">see src/app.coffee</div>
<p>In addition to the <strong>view function</strong>, a component
often contains a <strong>controller function</strong>. Like the
view, it returns an object.</p>
<p>Although there are intermediate steps that we'll cover later,
program flow is generally like this:<br>
<code>m.mount(el, App) -&gt; App.controller() -&gt; App.view()
-&gt; browser</code><br>
Note that if the controller is omitted, in the background Mithril
supplies one equal to a function that returns an empty object.
Among the controller's many responsibilities, it may pass data to
the view. This happens automatically. The view receives the
returned object from the controller as a parameter. By convention,
we call it <strong>ctrl</strong>.</p>
<p>In the code, the controller supplies data to the view in the
object key/value pair: <code>displayLogo: true</code>, a boolean
switch that turns the Logo component on and off. The view accesses
it in the passed-in object: <code>ctrl.displayLogo</code>, then
displays the Logo depending on it's value.</p>

<div class="dothis">change the value of displayLogo from true to
false. With the cursor still in the editor, save the file CTRL-S or
CMD-S, and watch the logo at the top of the page disappear.</div>

<h3>Component agruments</h3>
<p>It's possible to pass arguments to a component before it's
rendered to the virtual DOM using the method: m.component.
An "args" object is passed to both the
controller and the view. A common technique is to provide default values
within the component and optionally override those defaults in the
arguments object.</p>

<code class="comment">// App.view</code><br>
<code>m.component(Header, {title: "Lesson 3"})</code><br>
...<br>
<code class="comment">// Header</code><br>
<code>controller: function(args){... //args.title = "Lesson 3"</code><br>
<code>view: function(ctrl, args){... //args.title = "Lesson 3"</code>

<div class="dothis">see src/app.coffee. Notice how m.component()
is called with 2 arguments. 'Header' and an optional object with
'title' and 'subtitle' as keys.</div>

<div class="dothis">see src/components/Header.coffee</div>

<h3>Data Model</h3>
<p>In MVC, M is for model, V is for view, and C is for controller. Now let's
look at the role the model plays in supplying data to the view.</p>
<p>The model acquires data from an outside source and passes it on to the rest
of our app. Data could come from a
<a href="http://rest.elkstein.org/2008/02/what-is-rest.html">REST</a>-ful
connection to a database, a websocket, the browser's localstorage, or any
type of web service like Twitter or Google Maps.
In this lesson we are going to hard code the data in the model object.</p>

<div class="dothis">See src/components/Footer.coffee</div>

<p>The model is usually an object with data properties and possibly
functions that massage the data. It can be internal to a component,
but it's often defined outside to give data access to a controller, a view,
and even other components. </p>

<p>In the next lesson we'll see MVC in action. We'll learn how to control
the flow of data through our app: how to retrieve it from the server,
display it on the screen, and receive input from user interaction.</p>
