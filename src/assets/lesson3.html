<p>If the view could only hold static data, there would be no need
to learn Mithril. We can funnel data into the view from several
sources. As we shall see, the view can print the data or alter it
to enhance its presentation.</p>

<h3>Data from the contoller</h3>
<div class="dothis">see src/app.coffee</div>
<p>In addition to the <strong>view function</strong>, a component
often contains a <strong>controller function</strong>. Like the
view, it returns an object.</p>
<p>Although there are intermediate steps that we'll cover later,
program flow is generally like this:<br>
<code>m.mount(el, App) -&gt; App.controller() -&gt; App.view()
-&gt; browser</code><br>
Remember that if the controller is omitted, Mithril supplies one.
Among the controller's many responsibilities, it may pass data to
the view. This happens automatically. The view receives the
returned object from the controller as a parameter. By convention,
we call it <strong>ctrl</strong>.</p>
<p>In the code, the controller supplies data to the view in the
object key/value pair: <code>displayLogo: true</code>, a boolean
switch that turns the Logo component on and off. The view accesses
it in the passed-in object: <code>ctrl.displayLogo</code>, then
displays the Logo depending on it's value.</p>
<div class="dothis">change the value of displayLogo from true to
false. With the cursor still in the editor, save the file CTRL-S or
CMD-S, and watch Logo disappear.</div>

<h3>Data as argument to the component</h3>
<div class="dothis">see src/app.coffee. Notice how m.components()
is called with 2 arguments. 'Header' and an optional object with
'title' and 'subtitle' as keys.</div>
<p>It's possible to pass arguments to a component before it's
rendered to the screen. An arguments objects is passed to both the
controller and the view. A common technique is to provide default values
within the component and optionally override those defaults in the
arguments object.</p>
<code>m.component(Header, {title: "Lesson 3"})</code>
<div class="dothis">see src/components/Header.coffee</div>

<h3>Data Model</h3>
<p>In MVC, M is for model, V is for view, and C is for controller. Now let's
look at role the model plays in supplying data to the view.</p>
<p>The model acquires data from an outside source and passes it on to the rest
of our app. Data could come from a
<a href="http://rest.elkstein.org/2008/02/what-is-rest.html">REST</a>-ful
connection to a database, a websocket, the browser's localstorage, or any
type of web service like Twitter or Google Maps.
In this lesson we are going to hard code the data in the model object.</p>
<p>The model is usually an object with data properties and optionally,
functions that massage the data. These functions are utilized in the view or
more commonly, the controller. They can limit the data by date, 
income, or popularity. They can convert units to the current locale. They can
re-order the data, filter it, augment it. Functions supplied my the model
object can manipulate the data in
any way you wish.</p>

<p>In the next lesson we'll see MVC in action. We'll learn how to control
the flow of data through our app: how to retrieve it from the server,
display it on screen, and the user interact with it.</p>
