The Controller should connect the Model with the View
but shouldn't know anything about the inner workings of either. Our
controller is too tightly coupled with the View and Model, so now we
factor out our controller logic to the companion to our data model: the
view-model.

There are many definitions of the MVC paradigm. The role of the Model might be
the most controversial. One approach is to make the model the single source
of authority for all data state and view state.
Our model will have these responsibilities:
<ul>
  <li>Store data in memory</li>
  <li>Maintain the state of the data</li>
  <li>Receive data from the UI</li>
  <li>Maintain the state of the UI</li>
</ul>
In a real world scenario, data would be served-from and save-to some sort of
database on a server. We've already learned how to get json data
with m.request(). We'll learn to save data to the server in a later lesson.
The view-model would be resposible for making this happen.

This lesson is primarily contained in the code comments.
The code in the Todo List component is exactly as seen on the
<a href="http://mithril.js.org/getting-started.html" target="_blank">
Mithril Getting Started</a> page. Carefully, read through the comments
in <code class="file">Todo5.4.coffee</code> and feel free to play around.

<div class="dothis">
Open the console<br>(ESC while the cursor is in the editor window)
<h5>Try the following commands:</h5>
<p>
todo.vm.description("breathe more air")
todo.vm.add(todo.vm.description)
todo.vm.list.length
todo.vm.list[0].description()
</p>
<p>
Add more tasks through the user interface below.
Then try those last two commands in the console with a different index.
