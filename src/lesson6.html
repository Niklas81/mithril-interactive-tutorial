<div class="dothis">src/Todo5.coffee</div>
<p>User experience is defined as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>User enters task description and clicks the Add button</li>
    <li>A list of added tasks appears below the input</li>
    <li>User checks "done" and task is marked with a line through</li>
  </ul>
</p>

We need to build functionality to fulfill each UX requirement.
This is a working example of our Todo List component. Try it out!
