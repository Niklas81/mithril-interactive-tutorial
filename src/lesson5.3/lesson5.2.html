<p>The Controller decides what data in our Model should be available to the View. It may
optionally manipulate that data as it passes through. The Controller can also pass input
coming from the View back to the Model. In the next lesson we'll learn to simplify our
controller.</p>

<h3>Bi-Directional Data Flow</h3>

<p>Our controller is responsible for passing data back and forth
between the model and the view. The <code>add</code> method must keep the
information in the view in sync with the data in our model. The input <code>value</code>
must be set when the <code>Add</code> button is clicked. We handle this by setting the
input value to the result of calling our getter/setter <code>todo.description()</code>.
The Model must be updated as well. This requires the mithril function <code>m.withAttr()</code>
which is explained thoroughly in the comments in the source code.

  With minor changes to the code, see if you can add a date to each new task,
  and instead of drawing a line through a "done" todo, remove it from the list.
