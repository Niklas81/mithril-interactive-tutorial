<p>The Controller decides what data in our Model should be available to the View. It may
optionally manipulate that data as it passes through. The Controller can also pass input
coming from the View back to the Model. In the next lesson we'll learn to simplify our
controller.

<p>Our controller is responsible for passing data back and forth
between the model and the view. The <code>ctrl.add</code> method takes a
description from the text input in the view, instantiates a new
<code>todo.Todo</code> with that description, and adds it
to our <code>todo.TodoList</code>.
The input <code>value</code> is set when the
<code>Add</code> button is clicked. We handle this by setting the input value
with the m.prop getter/setter <code>ctrl.description()</code>.
The Model must be updated as well. This requires the mithril function
<code>m.withAttr()</code> which is explained thoroughly
in the comments in the source code.

  With minor changes to the code, see if you can add a date to each new task,
  and instead of drawing a line through a "done" todo, remove it from the list.
