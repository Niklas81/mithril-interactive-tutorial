The Controller should connect the Model with the View
but shouldn't know anything about the inner workings of either. Our
controller is too tightly coupled with the View and Model, so now we
factor out our controller logic to the companion to our data model: the
view-model.

There are many definitions of the MVC paradigm. The role of the Model might be
the most controversial. One approach is to make the model the single source
of authority for all data state and view state.
Our model will have these responsibilities:
<ul>
  <li>Store data in memory</li>
  <li>Maintain the state of the data</li>
  <li>Receive data from the UI</li>
  <li>Maintain the state of the UI</li>
</ul>
</p>

The code in the Todo List app is exactly as seen on the

Mithril Getting Started</a> page. It has been heavily commented.
Carefully, read through the comments
in <code class="file">Todo5.3.coffee</code>
