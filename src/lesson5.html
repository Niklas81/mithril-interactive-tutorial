<p>
  The <a href=
  "http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/getting-started.html" target=
  "_blank"><strong>Getting Started</strong></a> page of the
  Mithril documentation
  takes you through the steps of developing a classic Todo app. This
  lesson will do the same, but at a slower pace and with
  opportunities to interact directly with the code.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is composed of a series of steps on individual pages. We will
  learn to make Single Page Apps in a later lesson, but sometimes separate
  pages are the best choice. The Mithril Home Page is a typical website
  with individual pages, yet Mithril components are scattered throughout.
</p>
<p>
  The components for this lesson are reused on each
  page. They are written so that defaults can be overridden to
  individualize each page.
