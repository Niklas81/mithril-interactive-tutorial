  The <a href=
  "http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/getting-started.html" target=
  "_blank"><strong>Getting Started</strong></a> page of the
  Mithril documentation teaches you how to build a classic todo list. This
  lesson will show you a working Todo List component that you can modify
  and experiment with.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is composed of a series of steps on individual pages. Each
  page is a complete Mithril application, but static. In a later lesson
  we will learn to build Single Page Apps (SPA), allowing us to morph one page
  into endless configurations. But sometimes we want separate pages with
  components mixed in. The Mithril home page is a typical website
  with individual pages, yet Mithril components are scattered throughout.
</p>
<p>
  The components for this lesson are reused on each page.
  They do not persist in the browser, they are re-loaded with each page
  change. They are reused in the sense that the components can be customized
  to individualize each page. 
  <div class="dothis">src/app.coffee</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Logo</li>
    <li>Header</li>
    <li>Content</li>
    <li>Todo</li>
    <li>Footer</li>
    <li>- Menu</li>
  </ul>
  The Logo, Header and Footer are written so that defaults can be overridden to
  individualize each page. Content is just static HTML. Todo is our example
  app. We've also nested a Menu component inside the Footer. See 
  <code class="file">Footer.coffee</code>.

<div class="dothis">src/Todo5.coffee</div>
<p>Our intended user experience is defined as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>User inputs task description and clicks Add button</li>
    <li>List of added tasks appears below input</li>
    <li>User checks "done" and task is marked with line through</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
We need to build functionality to fulfill each UX requirement.
This is a working example of our Todo List component. Try it out!
