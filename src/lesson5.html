<p>
  The <a href=
  "http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/getting-started.html" target=
  "_blank"><strong>Getting Started</strong></a> page of the
  Mithril documentation teaches you how to build a classic todo list. This
  lesson will show you a working Todo List component that you can modify
  and experiment with.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is composed of a series of steps on individual pages. We will
  learn to make Single Page Apps in a later lesson, but sometimes separate
  pages are the best choice. The Mithril home page is a typical website
  with individual pages, yet Mithril components are scattered throughout.
</p>
<p>
  The components for this lesson are reused on each
  page.
  <div class="dothis">src/app.coffee</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Logo</li>
    <li>Header</li>
    <li>Content</li>
    <li>Todo</li>
    <li>Footer</li>
  </ul>
  The Header and Footer are written so that defaults can be overridden to
  individualize each page.
</p>

<div class="dothis">src/Todo5.coffee</div>
<p>User experience is defined as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>User enters task description and clicks the Add button</li>
    <li>A list of added tasks appears below the input</li>
    <li>User checks "done" and task is marked with a line through</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
We need to build functionality to fulfill each UX requirement.
This is a working example of our Todo List component. Try it out!
