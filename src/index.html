<h1>Welcome to M.I.T.</h1>

<!--
We can mount our app on document.body or any descendent element.
This tutorial is mounted on the body, so the above text
"Welcome to M.I.T." (and these comments)
will be replaced with the tutorial app.
On a slow connection as the page loads,
you might briefly see the welcome message.
In practice we would leave the body empty.

Browserfy.js created bundle.js which incudes mithril.js
This is a development choice that has nothing to do with Mithril.
Under the Elements tab of DevTools you won't see a script tag for bundle.js
It was replaced along with the rest of the body by the tutorial app.
Lucky for us, bundle.js was loaded before mithril.js could replace it.

You might see an error in the console like this:

"Please ensure the DOM element exists before rendering a template into it."

To ensure that that the DOM element exists,
load your main script at the end of the body like this:
-->

<script src="bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

</body>
</html>
